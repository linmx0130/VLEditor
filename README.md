Default icons is created by http://www.icons8.com, published under CC-by-nd 3.0 Unported.

##Features
* Only based on jQuery
* Only use the APIs which are supported well in different borrowers.
* Lightweight and simple
* Full of comments and hackable.

##Why I build it
* I need a lightweight editor for my course project.
* It's a course project so my teacher forbid me to use any other javascript library except jQuery. (T,T)

That's why I build this project while I know there are good free WYSIWYG editors.
